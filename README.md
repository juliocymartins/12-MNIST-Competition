## Project Description
The MNIST Digit Recognition Project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately classify handwritten digits. MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is a widely used dataset in computer vision, serving as a benchmark for classification algorithms. This project is part of a Kaggle competition where participants are tasked with exploring various machine learning approaches to solve the digit recognition task and achieve high categorization accuracy.

The project involves the following stages:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Importing the dataset, examining its structure, and performing initial visual analysis to understand the distribution of labels and features.

2. **Data Wrangling:** Tasks include splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, scaling pixel values, and reshaping data to match the input requirements of machine learning models.

3. **Building Machine Learning Models:** Implementing machine learning models, such as feedforward neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify handwritten digits.

4. **Final Conclusions:** Concluding the project by visualizing model predictions and generating a submission file for evaluation in the competition.

### Competition Evaluation
- **Goal:** The primary objective is to correctly identify handwritten digits from the test set.
- **Metric:** Evaluation is based on the categorization accuracy of predictions, measured as the percentage of images correctly classified.
